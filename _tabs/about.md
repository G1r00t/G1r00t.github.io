I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong background in the field of Cloud Security. Being a Cryptographer and CTF Player at one of the top CTF teams in the world `InfoSecIITR`

Apart from security, I have been involved in Low-level development using modern languages like C++ and Go. 
And now I am trying my hand in Rust. 

In my free time sometimes I also like to do some Competitive Programming.

InfoSecIITR has also helped me in integration with various security projects like Stellar_Pods that have helped me learn and explore more in the fields of Kubernetes. 

In the field of cybersecurity, there is actually no limit, as soon as a software is developed thousand ways are there to exploit it , but if we can find those thousand ways we can surely find the one way to defend it.
